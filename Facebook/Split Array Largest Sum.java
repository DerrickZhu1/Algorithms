The answer is between maximum value of input array numbers and sum of those numbers.
Use binary search to approach the correct answer.
We have l = max number of array; r = sum of all numbers in the array;
Every time we do mid = (l + r) / 2;

Use greedy to narrow down left and right boundaries in binary search.
